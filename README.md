# Chonker: Data Utilities for NLP and Machine Learning

Welcome to Chonker! This code was assembled to provide a library to make data-intensive tasks just a little easier. Right now, Chonker is quite small: made up of one key module (wrangle) with one more currently in development (chonktorch). As a full-time student/researcher, 100% of this code develops from use in my ongoing projects. Chonker provides a neat package for myself and others who want to reuse convenient data functions instead of rebuilding them every time. If you somehow happen upon this library, I hope that something in here may be of use to you too!

## Modules
### chonker.wrangle
A module containing classes and functions designed to streamline data pre- and post-processing (i.e. wrangling)
### chonker.chonktorch (forthcoming)
A module for pre-built neural models for NLP, based off of my research and built on PyTorch
